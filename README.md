This project was built in two weeks as our capstone project for Le Wagon's Certificate in Web Development course.

Force directed graph was built using [vasturiano's force graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph "force-graph by vasturiano")

## Usage

[![](https://markdown-videos.deta.dev/youtube/Jxa7PFylvis)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxa7PFylvis)

- After creating an account, users input information like their soft skills and subjects they have studied
- These inputs generate a personalised list of careers that are good matches
- Users can then view related university programmes for each suggested career
- Users can shortlist university programmes to be compared side-by-side
- Users can choose a university programme to pursue and set it as their goal
- Users can view deadlines and add to-do's to help them reach their goal on their personalised dashboard

## Known issues

As this project is a proof-of-concept demo, only a limited number of careers/university programmes are available.

The app works best with the following inputs:

- Occupation: student entering university
- Subjects: English, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics
- Soft Skills: Communication, Problem-Solving, Analytical Skills, Teamwork, Critical Thinking

Works best on desktop.
